### About
This application allows the user to read number on a bill, using OCR, and send it to his clipboard.
It is fully functional on Windows, I got some problems with Ubuntu.

### What are its dependencies? 
* PySimpleGUI
* pytesseract
* pyscreenshot
* pyperclip
* Tesseract OCR

> When you run this script, it automatically installs its dependencies.

### Installing Tesseract
I used an Open Source called Tesseract, to install it you follow the instructions on this <a href="https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki">website</a>.
